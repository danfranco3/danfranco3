ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Franco, a Brazilian student in Porto, Portugal.
- Iâ€™m interested in data science, machine learning, and software development.
- Currently working as a Machine Learning Intern using Computer Vision to reduce waste in the textile industry.
- Iâ€™m studying for my M.S. in Computer Science at the same Uni where I got my Bachelor's, the University of Porto, graduating in 2025.
- And I'm always looking for opportunities!
